This code works, **if** proper constants are used. It is not simple or trivial and it uses external setups.

- I have used my private Azure Portal to create the API and get the clinet ID etc. For that minimum you need is microsoft ID.
- For local windows user/pwd combination I warmly suggest to create user to the purpose to use it here. 
- To find out your usual WIN10 user name and pwd to be used in here is not trivial either.

If none of this means anything to you, eithe give up or ask expert help.
